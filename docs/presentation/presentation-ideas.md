# presentation ideas

## idea 1: cooking show

food network style demo. muffin man opens with a guitar song, then host takes over like guy fieri. walk through features as "rounds" of the show. muffin man comes back at the end for a closing riff.

## idea 2: infomercial

black-and-white disaster scenes (empty fridge, burning food, sad ramen) then "there HAS to be a better way!" cut to color, munchmates saves the day. "but wait there's MORE" between each feature. muffin man plays jingle at the end.

## idea 3: reality competition

chopped/masterchef style. host, 2 contestants, judges with funny commentary. 3 rounds demoing features. big reveal: mystery judge chair spins around and it's the muffin man with a guitar.

## idea 4: roommate sitcom

"six hungry engineers" - cold open arguing about dinner, someone discovers munchmates. each person is a character who demos the feature that fits them. talking head confessionals between demos. muffin man is the wacky neighbor.

## idea 5: news broadcast

breaking news format. anchor at a desk reports on a "crisis" - college students can't figure out what to eat. cuts to "field reporters" who demo different features live on location (kitchen, grocery store, dorm room). muffin man is the weatherman who does the forecast in food puns.

## idea 6: documentary / mockumentary

nature documentary voice narrating college students in their "natural habitat." "here we observe the engineering student... it's been 3 days since a proper meal..." follow a student's journey through the app like it's a wildlife survival story. dead serious narration over ridiculous footage.

## idea 7: movie trailer

edit the whole thing like an epic movie trailer. dramatic music, quick cuts, big text on screen. "in a world... where six engineers... couldn't figure out dinner..." build tension, reveal munchmates like it's the hero of an action movie. muffin man does a post-credits scene with the guitar.

## idea 8: tech keynote parody

steve jobs / apple keynote style. turtleneck, dramatic pauses, "one more thing..." between features. treat every feature reveal like it's revolutionary. audience gasps. muffin man walks out for the "one more thing" moment with the guitar.

## bonus ideas

- bloopers reel during credits
- matching chef hats or aprons
- munch mascot in the corner of the screen like a TV logo
