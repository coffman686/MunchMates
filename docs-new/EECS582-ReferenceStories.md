| 1                     | 1          | MunchMates - Sprint 2    | Implemented a "Clear All" button on the ingredient input screen that removes all entered ingredients from the list. Includes a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion of user entries.                                                       |
| 2                     | 2          | MunchMates - Sprint 2    | Built an auto-suggestion feature for ingredient input that displays a dropdown of common ingredients as the user types. Suggestions are filterable and selectable to speed up the entry process.                                                         |
| 3                     | 3          | MunchMates - Sprint 2    | Implemented the "Forgot Password" flow with UI and backend integration. Users enter their email, receive a reset link via Firebase Auth, and receive confirmation feedback upon successful request.                                                      |
| 4                     | 5          | MunchMates - Sprint 3    | Created a reusable recipe card component displaying recipe image, title, and summary info. Integrated a "Save Recipe" button that toggles saved state and syncs with the user's Firebase database.                                                       |
| 5                     | 8          | MunchMates - Sprint 3    | Integrated with Spoonacular Recipe API to fetch recipes based on user-entered ingredients. Built the API service layer, parsed responses into recipe model objects, and implemented error handling for network failures and API limits.                  |
| 6                     | 13         | MunchMates - Sprint 4    | Developed a weekly meal planner allowing users to assign saved recipes to calendar days via drag-and-drop. Implemented automatic grocery list generation with ingredient aggregation, de-duplication logic, and a dedicated screen with checkable items. |
| 7                     | 1          | EECS 658 - HW 1          | Implemented a polynomial regression model in Python. Trains using gradient descent to find the best fit $\theta$ for a cubic function. Prints training statistics, as well as final model parameters and visualizations.                                 |
| 8                     | 2          | EECS 268 - Assignment 4  | Developed a simulation of a CPU scheduler. Input is provided as a file of formatted instructions. Dictated by a rule based instruction scheduling procedure to determine task runtime eligibility and time.                                              |
| 9                     | 3          | EECS 388 - Final Project | Implemented a path following algorithm for a simple car with LIDAR, vision, and servos. Provides steering, acceleration, and collision avoidance through visual processing and distance detection.                                                       |
| 10                    | 5          | EECS 658 - HW 3          | Implemented the LeNet CNN architecture with with pytorch as a classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset. Further utilized PCA and tSNE models for dimensionality reduction to visualize data classification clusters.                                     |
| 11                    | 8          | EECS 678 - Lab 8         | Implemented several CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Queues. Included support for preemption within each schedule. Matched reference output exactly to ensure correctness.                                      |
| 12                    | 13         | EECS 678 - QUASH         | Developed a simple UNIX shell, supported the most common builtin shell commands. Supports environment variables, forking, redirection, piping, and background processes/jobs for a minimalist yet complete command-line interface.                       |
